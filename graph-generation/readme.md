# Generating graphs with GraphRNN


This is the implementation of the paper "GraphRNN: Generating Realistic Graphs with Deep Auto-regressive Models".
The aim is to implement a neural network that is fed with graphs beforehand and then generates new ones.
An example application would be to take organic molecules as graphs and then create new potential compounds (You et al. 2018).
